## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this portfolio.

## Presentation

I am Émeric. Passionate about the web and new technologies in general, I am tech savvy, outgoing and, above all, willing to roll up my sleeves to get things done in a rapidly changing environment. My goal? Working with great people on great projects. I am currently working as Developer Front/End at La Compagnie Hyperactive and  Cartégie. Being a true creative, I am really big on design. That, is what fuels my passion for my job: “Bring life to the web design”.

**Always tuned to the market, I am looking for new challenges and opportunities for collaboration!** 🚀
